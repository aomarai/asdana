1. Always write relevant unit tests whenever any code changes are made.
2. Always make sure all build linting and tests come back 10/10 and 100% without any failures.
3. Always try to make code clean and follow the DRY principles when it makes sense.
4. If making changes to a PR, always ensure that all the changes are still relevant.
